            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meats:</strong> A pound of ground meat (1/2 pound pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef)</li>
                <li><strong>Onions:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until transluscent with the ground meat</li>
                <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes:</strong> A can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh Herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> Season with dried basil, dried oregano, salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Uncooked noodles are best, but you can use oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Use cottage cheese and parmasean for the layer. Add shredded mozzarella for the topping.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent to hold it all together.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven at 375 degrees F for about half an hour. 
                    Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
